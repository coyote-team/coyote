License Grants and Conditions<br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>2.1. Grants<br/><br/>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>non-exclusive license:<br/><br/>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br/>    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br/>    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br/>    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br/>    as part of a Larger Work; and<br/><br/>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br/>    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br/>    Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br/><br/>2.2. Effective Date<br/><br/>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br/>become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br/>distributes such Contribution.<br/><br/>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br/><br/>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br/>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br/>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br/>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br/>Contributor:<br/><br/>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br/>    or<br/><br/>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#39;s<br/>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br/>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br/>    Version); or<br/><br/>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br/>    its Contributions.<br/><br/>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br/>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br/>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/><br/>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br/><br/>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br/>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br/>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br/>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br/><br/>2.5. Representation<br/><br/>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br/>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br/>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br/><br/>2.6. Fair Use<br/><br/>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br/>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br/>equivalents.<br/><br/>2.7. Conditions<br/><br/>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br/>in Section 2.1.<br/><br/>3. Responsibilities<br/>-------------------<br/><br/>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br/><br/>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br/>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br/>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br/>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br/>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br/>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code<br/>Form.<br/><br/>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/><br/>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/><br/>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br/>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br/>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br/>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br/>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/><br/>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br/>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br/>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br/>    the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/><br/>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/><br/>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br/>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br/>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br/>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br/>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br/>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br/>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br/>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br/>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br/>License(s).<br/><br/>3.4. Notices<br/><br/>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br/>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br/>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br/>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br/>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/><br/>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/><br/>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br/>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br/>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br/>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br/>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br/>jurisdiction.<br/><br/>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br/>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br/>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br/>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br/>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br/>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/><br/>5. Termination<br/>--------------<br/><br/>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br/>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br/>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br/>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br/>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br/>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br/>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br/>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br/>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br/>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br/>Your receipt of the notice.<br/><br/>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br/>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br/>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br/>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br/>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br/>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br/><br/>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br/>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br/>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/><br/>************************************************************************<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>*  6.

The entire risk as to the     *<br/>*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *<br/>*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *<br/>*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *<br/>*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *<br/>*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *<br/>*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>************************************************************************<br/><br/>************************************************************************<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *<br/>*  --------------------------                                          *<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *<br/>*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *<br/>*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *<br/>*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *<br/>*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *<br/>*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *<br/>*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *<br/>*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *<br/>*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *<br/>*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *<br/>*  personal injury resulting from such party&#39;s negligence to the       *<br/>*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *<br/>*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *<br/>*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *<br/>*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *<br/>*                                                                      *<br/>************************************************************************<br/><br/>8. Litigation<br/>-------------<br/><br/>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br/>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br/>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br/>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring<br/>cross-claims or counter-claims.<br/><br/>9. Miscellaneous<br/>----------------<br/><br/>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br/>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br/>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br/><br/>10. Versions of the License<br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>10.1. New Versions<br/><br/>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br/>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br/>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br/>distinguishing version number.<br/><br/>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br/><br/>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br/>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br/>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br/>steward.<br/><br/>10.3. Modified Versions<br/><br/>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br/>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br/>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br/>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br/>such modified license differs from this License).<br/><br/>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary<br/>Licenses<br/><br/>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With<br/>Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the<br/>notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</div></div>
