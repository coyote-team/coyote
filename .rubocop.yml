Layout/IndentHeredoc:

  # reason: Rubocop doesn't seem to handle <<~-style heredocs well
  
Bundler/OrderedGems:

  # reason: I think this is too picky

Style/BlockDelimiters:
  EnforcedStyle: braces_for_chaining

Style/EmptyMethod:
  Enabled: false
  # reason: usually a method is left empty more as a guide to the user, as with simple Rails actions that just render a view

Performance/RedundantMerge:
  Enabled: false
  # reason: .merge/.merge! is helpful for concision when setting multiple keys at once
  
Style/BracesAroundHashParameters:
  Enabled: false
  # reason: I think adding a brace to hashes in a multiline set of parameters is easier to read/more clear

  Enabled: false
