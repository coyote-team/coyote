  | The Coyote Scavenger Hunt uses descriptions that were originally created to help visitors who are or blind or have low vision enjoy artworks and cultural objects. Its software was developed by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and Prime Access Consulting to support the authoring, management, and publication of visual descriptions for web visitors.

  | The generous support of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Lois and Steve Eisen and The Eisen Family Foundation has made it possible for us to share the open-source Coyote software with other institutions and to produce the description-based Coyote Scavenger Hunt.
